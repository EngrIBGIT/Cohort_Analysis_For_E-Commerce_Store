## Cohort Analysis for Customer Retention

## Project Overview

This project conducts a **cohort analysis** to evaluate customer retention patterns and trends over time. Cohort analysis is a powerful tool for segmenting users based on shared characteristics and analyzing how their behavior evolves over different time periods. This analysis focuses on understanding how customer engagement and retention vary across different customer cohorts.

**Objectives:**
- Understand the retention rate of customers over time.
- Identify patterns of customer churn.
- Provide insights into customer behavior to inform retention strategies.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following key columns:
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Transaction Date**: The date when a transaction was made.
- **Amount**: The transaction value.
- **Sign-up Date**: The date when the customer first registered.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you need to install the following packages:


pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cohort-analysis.git 

Navigate to the project directory:

cd cohort-analysis
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook cohort_analysis_solution.ipynb

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Summary Statistics
We begin by examining the basic statistics of the dataset, such as the number of unique customers, total revenue, and the distribution of transactions over time.


# Example: Checking dataset statistics
df.describe()
2. Customer Lifecycle Analysis
This analysis identifies key lifecycle moments for customers, including their first transaction and the length of time they remain active.


# Code to calculate first and last transactions per customer
first_purchase = df.groupby('CustomerID')['TransactionDate'].min()
Cohort Analysis Approach
We define cohorts based on the customer sign-up date and track their behavior month over month.

1. Defining Cohorts
Customers are segmented into cohorts based on their sign-up month.

# Example: Create a cohort index
df['CohortMonth'] = df['SignUpDate'].apply(lambda x: x.strftime('%Y-%m'))
2. Monthly Retention Table
We calculate the retention rate for each cohort over time, producing a table that shows the percentage of retained customers for each cohort.


# Example: Creating a retention matrix
cohort_counts = cohort_data.pivot_table(index='CohortMonth', columns='CohortIndex', values='CustomerID', aggfunc='nunique')
3. Visualizing Retention Trends
We use heatmaps to visualize customer retention over time. This makes it easier to spot trends and cohorts that exhibit particularly high or low retention rates.


# Visualizing retention with Seaborn heatmap
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(cohort_data, annot=True, fmt='.0%', cmap='Blues')

Results
Key Findings:

Retention Trends: The retention rate significantly declines after the first month, highlighting a drop-off in customer engagement.
Best Performing Cohorts: Certain cohorts, particularly those from early sign-up months, have higher retention rates over time, suggesting strong initial engagement efforts.
Churn Patterns: Over time, the majority of customers churn after their second month.

Visualizations
1. Retention Heatmap
The retention heatmap visually demonstrates the percentage of retained customers for each cohort.

2. Cohort Retention Curve
A line graph plotting the retention curve for key cohorts, showing how retention rates evolve over time.

Recommendations
1. Focus on Early Engagement
Given that the majority of churn happens within the first month, businesses should invest in improving early customer experiences. Offering incentives for continued engagement, such as discounts or loyalty programs, could help improve retention.

2. Target High-Retention Cohorts
Identify the characteristics of cohorts that exhibit higher retention rates and tailor marketing strategies to attract similar customers.

3. Analyze Churn Causes
Perform additional analysis to understand why customers are churning after the first month and address any friction points in the customer journey.

Conclusion
This cohort analysis provides valuable insights into customer retention trends, helping businesses tailor their engagement strategies to improve long-term customer loyalty. By focusing on improving early engagement and addressing churn issues, businesses can enhance overall retention rates and customer satisfaction.
